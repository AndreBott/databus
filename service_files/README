Installing DataBus as a system service

DataBus is an open-source database management system. It is typically used with cassandra to manage building management data.
This file describes a method of using DataBus as a "System V"-style system service on Ubuntu GNU/Linux. There are many possible configurations of a system service, and you should be prepared to modify the files here to suit your needs.

After the service files are installed, you can manage DataBus with system service commands start,stop,status,restart. For example:

  $ service databus status
  Wed Oct  2 12:48:06 PDT 2013 | 1 DataBus processes are running
   * DataBus webapp is running
  $


To install, run the script "databus_service_install.sh" as root (sudo) to create the necessary folders and files. This script assumes that DataBus is installed at /opt/databus, and that cassandra is already installed on the same system. This script will only add files to your system and DataBus installation, and will not otherwise modify the DataBus files.
