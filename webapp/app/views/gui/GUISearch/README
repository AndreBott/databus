Ok, should be very simple to get the search stuff going:
1.  update code to get everything new
2.  open a prompt, go to <SDI>/solr
3.  run 
java -jar start.jar

That should be it.  You'll find the solr console at 
http://localhost:8983/solr/
and you can query like so (once there is data to search):
http://localhost:8983/solr/<tablename>/select?q=*:*&wt=json
or the one off
http://localhost:8983/solr/databusmeta/select?q=*:*&wt=json

(all that is just solr, not related to databus at all)


Once you've created some searchable tables (look at 
RunSolrPost.java for the table register format for searchable 
tables) you can now use databus to search:

http://localhost:9000/api/search/<tablename>?q=*whatever*&wt=json&facet=true
or of course
http://localhost:9000/api/search/databusmeta?q=*somethingtosearchfor*&wt=json&facet=true

If you specify 'facet=true' but don't specify facets you want it will default to the 
facets specified in your table registration (columns that specify isFacet=true).
Other than that one case facets behave exactly like they always do in solr 
(i.e. you have to specify facet=true AND facet.field=blah&facet.field=blah2 
to get back any specific facets)

The only other change is that if 'df=blah' is NOT specified, I default to a 
composite field 'allTerms_texts' which contains all of the terms in all of the 
searchable fields.  If 'df=blah' IS specified, normal solr behavior takes over.
This behaves exactly like:
if (df=something) is not specified, add on "df=allTerms_texts".


I think that's it.  The results you get back will be *exactly* like solrs usual 
results.  Check out the solr docs for query params and output specifications. 
Specify wt=json for usable results (you can use wt=xml if you really 
want...).

Keep in mind that until you register a searchable table nothing will be in the index 
so you won't be able to search (obviously).  The only exception is databusmeta 
which will be populated as soon as you register any table (not just a searchable one) 
with the tables meta information (table name basically right now).

Yikes, that got long.

Let me know if you have questions...

// To populate Solr:
check out 'RunSolrPost.java' for an example registration request

haven't registered any searchable tables yet
10:15
if you want some garbage data to search, change line 60 of RunSolrPost to
10:15
private static final boolean SEARCHABLE = true;
10:15
that'll give you meta and some randomly named searchable tables
10:16
(they'll be named 'solrsPinkBlobXXXXXXXXDeviceMeta' and '...StreamMeta')
