<h1>Download Data</h1>

Downloading data is even simpler than uploading data. The rules for downloading data are:
<br /><br />
<ol>
   <li>Set http header of GET message of "Content-Type" as "application/json"</li>
   <li>Set the basic authentication username to the username(which may start with robot if using a robot)</li>
   <li>Set the basic authentication password from a users key(for old users, key may be prefixed with register:)</li>
   <li>Send the GET http request to https://databus.nrel.gov/api/getdataV1/{sqlquery}</li>
   <li>Let us know if you want to download a VERY large dataset(ie. greater than 10 minute download)</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />
Here are some scalable sql examples (and we do check security on the tables you are querying even if you do a join).  The SQL query
follows more of an object query language so you use c.owner knowing owner is a foreign key.  Also, for every space you would normally
use in SQL, you need to use a + instead.
<div class="apikey">
	<div class="key">
		https://databus.nrel.gov/api/getdataV1/select+c+from+DboColumnMeta+as+c+left+join+c.owner+as+table+where+table.name='pinkblob'
		https://databus.nrel.gov/api/getdataV1/select+t+from+TimeSeriesTable+as+t+where+t.time>1234234324343+and+t.time<=12343123243243
	</div>
</div>	

<br/><br/>
If you have a very large result set you want to download, you should code the client to download in chunks and download subset ranges of the data
as our load balancer can do the retries for you if there is a failure when we do our rolling upgrade so that you get all your data.

You can create robot users or your personal key for gets is below

<br /><br />
<div class="apikey">
	<div class="key">
	<br/>
	Your key(remove the quotes)="${user.apiKey}"
	<br/><br/>
	You have the following robot keys
<table border="0" class="data" cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0">
	<thead>
	    <tr>
	        <th>Robot Username</th>
	        <th>Api Key</th>
	    </tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	    #{list user.robots, as:'robot'}
	        <tr>
	            <td>${robot.name}</td>
	            <td>${robot.apiKey}</td>
	        </tr>
	    #{/list}
	</tbody>
</table>
	
	</div>
</div>
<br />

The json response is STREAMED back to you such that very large datasets can be sent back without running out of memory.  The result
format will look like as follows depending on your table's meta data
<br /><br />

<div class="apikey">
	<div class="key">
<pre>
{ "data": [
    {"time":"0", "color":"grey","volume":"23.2"},
    {"time":"10","color":"grey","volume":"23.2"},
    {"time":"11","color":"grey","volume":"23.2"},
    {"time":"30","color":"pink","volume":"34.5"},
    {"time":"51","color":"grey","volume":"23.2"},
    {"time":"53","color":"grey","volume":"23.2"}
          ] 
}
</pre>
	</div>
