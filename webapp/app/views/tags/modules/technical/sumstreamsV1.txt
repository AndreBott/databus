Allows users to take all values at time1 and add them up from multiple streams and similarly, it adds up time2 values, time3 values, etc. etc. The first step is to create a new aggregation as follows
Creating/Modifying an aggregation:
usage: POST to https://databus.nrel.gov/api/sumstreamsV1/register 
body: {"name":"{AggregationID}","group":"{GroupID}","urls":["{URL1}","{URL2}"] } 
example: {"name":"RSF_DATACENTER","group":"modbus","urls":["timeaverage/60000/rangeclean/-2000000/2000000/rawdata/D73937833phaseRealPower"]}

The next step is to use the aggregation. You can do that by getting data from the aggregation 

Getting data from an aggregation:
usage: https://databus.nrel.gov/api/sumstreamsV1/{AggregationID}/{start}/{end} 
example: https://databus.nrel.gov/api/sumstreamsV1/RSF_PV/1354738000000/1354824663000


If you would like to view an aggregation you already created, just use view an aggregation 
Viewing an existing aggregation:
usage:GET https://databus.nrel.gov/api/sumstreamsV1/aggregation/{AggregationID} 
example:GET https://databus.nrel.gov/api/sumstreamsV1/aggregation/RSF_DATACENTER


On deleting an aggregation, MAKE sure you do a POST not a GET. No body is required, just POST as in the below example supplying the aggregation id in the url Deleting aggregation:
usage:POST to https://databus.nrel.gov/api/sumstreamsV1/deleteagg/{AggregationID} 
example:POST to https://databus.nrel.gov/api/sumstreamsV1/deleteagg/RSF_DATACENTER
