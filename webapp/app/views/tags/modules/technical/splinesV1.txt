The spline module allows users to interpolate data. You choose how many datapoints to use in the spline as in the example below, windowSize=5 so 5 rows of rawdata are used to interpolate. You also choose the interval such that as in the example below, the spline will return a datapoint every 60 seconds since the interval is in milliseconds. NOTE: Currently, there is no code in the spline such that if there is missing data for say 10 intervals, it woudl return nulls. Instead it interpolates all data so always gives back data when you may not exactly want it(we plan on adding more in the future for this so you can specify when to not interpolate)
