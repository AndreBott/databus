Click the Documentation link to get started on installation if you are going to try it out

[Energy Databus Documentation(and support available)](http://buffalosw.com/products/databus/databus-documentation/)
[Energy Databus Community Forum](http://en.openei.org/community/group/databus) - Where General Users can get help
[Energy Databus Forum for Developers or Chart Creators](https://github.com/deanhiller/databus/wiki/Developer-Support-and-Help)
[Energy Databus Partners(they can help and support you)](http://en.openei.org/wiki/NREL_Energy_DataBus/Partners)

If after all that you are really in a bind to find something, you can email us at databus@nrel.gov.  However, we monitor the forums so we prefer you ask questions there first as the response time will be much faster as that has more eyeballs than our databus@nrel.gov emailing list
